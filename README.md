# Vote for your favorite dog!

<p>App that allows users to vote for their favorite dog breed. Each user can only vote once and votes are tracked in real time (updated without refreshing the page). </p>

## How it's made:

- EJS
- CSS
- JS
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Socket.io

## Reflections and Lessons Learned:

<p>This was a really neat exercise in using a new (to me) tech in Socket.io. It was extremely easy to use, and the documentation was very straight-forward which was helpful in getting the application running. </p>

## Optimizations

<p> User authentication to come in future integrations </p>

## Errors and bugs

<p> If something is behaving weirdly or unexpectedly, it is a bug! Please report it <a href="https://github.com/MagicMarcos/ExpressVoting/issues">here</a>.</p>

## Running locally

- Create a .env file
- Add your PORT and DB_string
- use `npm run start`
